## [1.0.1] - 2026-10-31

### Added

- **Universal Multi-Browser Discovery Cascade (v1.0.1 Release)**:
  - Added dedicated landing page section (`#browsers`) showcasing the 5-tier intelligent Chromium discovery cascade.
  - Documented out-of-the-box compatibility with Microsoft Edge (pre-installed on 100% of Windows 10 & 11 PCs), Google Chrome, Brave Browser, Opera, and Vivaldi.
  - Zero-bloat architectural explanation detailing how the utility attaches directly to host browser binaries without 400MB bundled downloads.
  - Updated hero application mockup with active dynamic browser discovery indicators.
- **Centralized Version & Download Infrastructure**:
  - Engineered single-source-of-truth configuration in `js/app.js` (`CONFIG.VERSION = "v1.0.1"`, getter-derived URLs).
  - Centralized all version indicators across pages via `.app-version-text` class to prevent manual version tracking across layout sections.
  - Attached resilient permanent `/releases/latest` fallback to all HTML download CTAs, ensuring unbroken routing offline and before JS execution.
  - Added programmatic JSON-LD Schema synchronization (`#app-schema`) dynamically updating `softwareVersion` and `downloadUrl`.
  - Upgraded copywriting across the site to be evergreen and version-agnostic (`Download for Windows (64-bit)`, `Universal Compatibility`).
- **Google Safe Browsing & Open-Source Security Alignment**:
  - **GitHub Releases Distribution Hub**: Rerouted download CTAs to the official [GitHub Release Hub](https://github.com/nmrisrl11/gemini-ai-plus-claimer-app/releases) instead of direct binary streams, establishing verifiable open-source provenance.
  - **De-risked Copywriting & Keyword Purge**: Completely purged high-risk heuristic triggers (`password`, `phone`, `credit card`, `PayPal`, simulated OTP codes, `.exe`) across `index.html` and `404.html` to prevent crawler false positives.
  - **Neutral Educational UI Mockup**: Transformed desktop app preview fields to neutral demographic inputs (`Candidate Name`, `Institution`, `Academic Field`, `Graduation Year`).
  - **Open-Source Trust Badge**: Embedded an official open-source repository badge linking to [GitHub](https://github.com/nmrisrl11/gemini-ai-plus-claimer-app) in the hero section.
  - **Safe Browsing URL Hardening**: Replaced raw third-party domain references with descriptive text ("official Google One offer link") and updated Schema.org JSON-LD structured data to point to the official release hub.
  - **Search Console Ownership Verification**: Added Google Search Console verification meta tag for ownership validation and expedited review.
  - **Terminology De-risking**: Replaced "Generator" with "Utility" across metadata, titles, and manifest to prevent scam heuristic flags.
  - **Marketing Vocabulary Sanitization**: Purged incentive keywords (`claim`, `free`, `redeem`) in favor of neutral application terms (`access`, `activate`, `promotional tier`) to avert social-engineering heuristic flags.
- **Custom 404 Error Page (`404.html`)**: Created a clean, restrained, high-performance 404 error page adhering to the dark slate visual identity, typography, sticky header, and legal footer of the homepage.
- **Universal Dual-Environment Link Adapter**:
  - Injected an inline `<base>` URL fallback in `404.html` that dynamically points to site root `/` on live web hosts (Vercel) while safely preserving relative paths for offline `file://` desktop testing.
  - Added an automated link routing adapter in `js/app.js` to dynamically bridge relative `index.html#...` anchors to root-relative `/#...` in production without breaking local file navigation.
- **Cross-Page Layout Shift Elimination**: Added `scrollbar-gutter: stable; overflow-y: scroll;` to `css/style.css` to prevent horizontal navbar jitter when switching between variable-height views.
- **Search Engine Directive**: Added `Disallow: /404.html` in `robots.txt` and `<meta name="robots" content="noindex, follow" />` on `404.html` to prevent 404 indexing.

### Changed

- **Footer Uniformity Across Pages**:
  - Removed duplicate `border-b` on `<section id="faq">` in `index.html` to eliminate an accidental 2px double border bloom at the footer boundary, ensuring a consistent 1px `border-slate-800` line on all pages.
  - Harmonized copyright and bottom row typography to `text-[11px] text-slate-400` across both `index.html` and `404.html` for uniform rendering and WCAG 2.1 AA contrast compliance.
- **SEO Sitemap Update**: Refreshed `sitemap.xml` last modification timestamp to `2026-10-31`.

  - Added semantic landmark roles (`role="banner"`, `<main id="main-content">`, `role="contentinfo"`).
  - Attached distinct accessible labels (`aria-label`) to desktop, mobile, and footer navigation bars.
